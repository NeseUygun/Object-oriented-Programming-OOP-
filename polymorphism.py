# Polymorphism in Class Methods
# It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.
#A child class inherits all the methods from the parent class. However, in some situations, the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit into the child class. 
#In such cases, you will have to re-implement method in the child class.
